    <p>My kids love them!</p>
    <p>You'll find a detailed ingredient list and step-by-step instructions in the recipe below, but let's go over the basics:</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Sugar</strong>: The recipe starts with 1 ½ cups white sugar. </li>
        <li><strong>Butter</strong>: Beat the sugar with two sticks of softened butter.</li>
        <li><strong>Eggs</strong>: Two eggs lend moisture and act as a binding agent, which means they help hold the dough together. </li>
        <li><strong>Vanilla</strong>: Vanilla extract enhances the overall flavor of the chocolate chocolate chip cookies. </li>
        <li><strong>Flour</strong>: All-purpose flour gives the cookie dough structure. </li>
        <li><strong>Cocoa powder</strong>: They wouldn’t be chocolate chocolate chip cookies without cocoa powder!</li>
        <li><strong>Baking soda</strong>: Baking soda acts as a leavener, which means it helps the cookies rise. </li>
        <li><strong>Salt</strong>: A pinch of salt enhances the overall flavor, but it won’t make the cookies taste salty. </li>
        <li><strong>Chocolate chips</strong>: You’ll need two cups of semisweet chocolate chips. </li>
        <li><strong>Walnuts (optional)</strong>: Walnuts are optional, but they add welcome crunch. </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Beat the wet ingredients in one bowl and the dry ingredients in another. </li>
        <li>Add the dry mixture to the wet mixture, then stir in the chocolate chips and nuts. </li>
        <li>Drop the dough onto baking sheets.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the cookies are set.</li>
    </ol>
